# Image-Caption-Generation
In this project we are building a caption generation model using the latest CNN
and LSTM architecture that can successfully predict the caption of an image. Our main objective was to
use the latest Xception model and see how much better it performs inview of other models like VGG16,
VGG19, Inception etc. The features were extracted with the help of Xception Model and These features were then transferred to the LSTM model which genrated the captions. The generated Captions were Evaluated on the basis of BLEU Score.
